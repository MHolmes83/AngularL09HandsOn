  AboutMe = "Growing up around computers I have always been interested in coding. However, I never really pursued it, due to a lack of confidence in my abilities, until 5 years ago, shortly after moving to New York when I was going through an employment program and found a site that tought basic coding skills and found it much more to my liking than I thought I would. So, I started looking for programs that would give me a more in-depth training in the field and came across Woz-U and signed up."
